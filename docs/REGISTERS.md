# Register map

Everything the component knows about, so you can reach a setting it does not model.

**Key** is what you write under `aecc:` to get a control, with `_number`, `_switch` or
`_select` after it. **Vendor name** is the identifier the vendor's own app uses, typos
included. **`scale:`** is the literal value to type when reaching the register by address
instead; a key already carries its own.

Verified on a Humsienk `HSBPSS2K5W7K68WHEU`. Other units on this platform run the same
firmware, but enum values and defaults differ between builds, so read a value back before
trusting it.

## Reaching a register the component does not model

Read one:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: aecc
    registers:
      - name: Parallel mode
        address: 0xA02C
        interval: 60s
```

Read and write one:

```yaml
aecc:
  registers:
    - name: Parallel mode
      address: 0xA02C
      max_value: 7
```

Or write once, without an entity, with the `aecc.write_register` action.

`scale` multiplies the register in both places, so a register holding tenths of a volt
wants `scale: 0.1`. A bare `aecc: registers:` entry defaults to `0`–`65535` at scale 1, so
set `max_value` to something the register actually accepts.

## Enum values

Values are the index into the vendor app's own list, in the order the app displays them,
confirmed against the app's own code.

Where the whole list is known the component exposes a `_select` with real labels. Where it
is not, there is no key at all: an index with no meaning attached is a worse control than
none, so reaching those takes an explicit `registers:` entry.

### Utility range

`0xA02B` `lineRangeSet` — the AC input acceptance window, narrowest first.

| | |
|---|---|
| `0` | UPS |
| `1` | APL |
| `2` | Generator |

### On-grid mode

`0xA034` `onGirdSet` — "PV to grid" means anti-backflow is *off*; `3` is the hook for
feeding a grid reading from your own meter rather than the bundled CT.

| | |
|---|---|
| `0` | Solar to load |
| `1` | PV to grid |
| `2` | Anti-backflow via CT |
| `3` | Anti-backflow via smart device |

### Parallel mode

`0xA02C` `paraModeSet` — `3` and `5`–`7` build a three-phase bank from three units; `4` is
split-phase.

| | |
|---|---|
| `0` | Stand-alone |
| `1` | Parallel |
| `2` | Split-phase reference |
| `3` | Split-phase at 120° |
| `4` | Split-phase at 180° |
| `5`–`7` | First, second, third of three phases |

### Battery type

`0xA08C` `batType` — only `6` = LiFePO4 16S was identified, so there is no key.

### BMS protocol

`0xA09A` `bmsProtocal` — only `1` = Pylontech was identified, so there is no key.

### Charge priority

`0xA02E` `chgPriority` — list not established, so there is no key.

### Inverter operating mode

`0xA028` `outPriority` — list not established and the register is not confirmed to be the
operating mode at all, so there is no key.

### Grid standard

`0xA043` `gridStandardSet` — picks one of the firmware's built-in profiles, and a profile
is nothing but a set of trip thresholds. Those thresholds live at `0xA04D`–`0xA0F9` and
are individually readable and writable, so where your grid operator requires particular
voltage or frequency limits, set them directly rather than trusting a profile to match.

| `0` | GNL |
| `1` | VDE4105 |
| `2` | IEEE1547 |

## The bundled CT meter

A separate Modbus device on its own bus. Slave 1, 9600 8N1, IEEE-754 float32 with
big-endian word order, so each value spans two registers.

| Address | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Line voltage, V |
| `12` | Active power, W — positive is importing |
| `18` | Apparent power, VA |

## The grid-tie cap lives in three places

`0xA03F`, a second copy at `0x9ACE`, and the energy manager's `3039`. Output tops out at
the lowest of them, and the vendor app displays the mirror rather than `0xA03F`.

`grid_export_limit_number` writes both Modbus copies. It does not write `3039`, which is
not on Modbus, so raising the cap above whatever `3039` holds changes nothing. To raise
`3039`, put an `ems 3039 <watts>` line in a restore file and POST it.

The name is the firmware's. It caps on-grid *output*, which includes power serving your
own load, so it is not an export limit on its own.

## Settings whose mapping is unconfirmed

**`0xA036` is named for the neutral–earth bond but may not be it.** It reads 1 while the
app shows it disabled, which inverts the polarity every other boolean follows, and
enabling it never produced a referenced island. It has no key, so reaching it takes an
explicit `registers:` entry.

**`0xA031` does not match the app.** It reads 35.0 A where the app shows 50 A for the same
setting. `0xA02F` matches its app figure correctly, so the discrepancy is specific to this
register.

**`0xA028` is plausibly the inverter operating mode** and was never confirmed against the
app.

## Not on Modbus

The energy manager's own registers — the schedule slots, the enable flag, the SOC window —
are only reachable over the unit's JSON API. The component handles those itself when you
give it a `datalogger:` block.
